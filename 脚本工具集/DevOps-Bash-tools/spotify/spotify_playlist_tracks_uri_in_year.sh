usage_description="
Returns the URIs of all tracks in a playlist which originated in the given year regex

Useful to find tracks from a given year or decade from existing playlists to create more specialised playlists

The regex is an anchored BRE format regex. Typically you'll want to provide a simple 4-digit year or 3 digits and a dot for a decade


Example:

This returns everything in MyPlaylist that had an original release date in the 1980s:

    ${0##*/} MyPlaylist 198.

Even if the track in the playlist is from a compilation released later, it will find the original release date by doing
a targeted search for that track using the Spotify API


Caveat: not every single track is findable in the Spotify Search API - there are some rare edge cases where certain versions won't be found even with broader simpler searches (eg. Nadia Ali  Call My Name Spencer Hill Radio Edit).
        Such tracks are now skipped rather than raising errors as it's better to take the 99% success rate than deal with the rare data issues in the Spotify API
