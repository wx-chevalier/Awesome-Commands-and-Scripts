usage_description="
Reads a value from the command line and saves it to GCP Secret Manager without echo'ing it on the screen

First argument is used as secret name
Second argument is used as secret string value
    - if this argument is a file, such as an SSH key, reads the file content and saves it as the secret value
    - if not given prompts for it with a non-echo'ing prompt (recommended for passwords)
Remaining args are passed directly to 'gcloud secrets'


If you get an error like this:

ERROR: (gcloud.secrets.create) FAILED_PRECONDITION: Constraint constraints/gcp.resourceLocations violated for [orgpolicy:projects/123456789012] attempting to create a secret in [global]. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/defining-locations.

Then just append the following gcloud secrets args when calling this script to set a location (change --locations to your preferred):

	--replication-policy user-managed --locations europe-west2
