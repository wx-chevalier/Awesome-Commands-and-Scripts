usage_description="
Run a command against each GCP project in the current account

This is powerful so use carefully!

WARNING: do not run any command reading from standard input, otherwise it will consume the project id/names and exit after the first iteration

Requires GCloud SDK to be installed and configured and 'gcloud' to be in the \$PATH

All arguments become the command template

The following command template tokens are replaced in each iteration:

Project ID:     {id}    {project_id}
Project Name:   {name}  {project_name}


eg.
    ${0##*/} 'echo GCP project has id {id} and name {name}'


For a more useful example, see:
