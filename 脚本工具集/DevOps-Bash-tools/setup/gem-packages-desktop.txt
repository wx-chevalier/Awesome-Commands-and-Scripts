# mdl needs ruby >= 2.4.0 whereas older Macs may have 2.3.0 - if so install manually via:
#
#       brew install ruby
#
#       GEM=/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/*/bin/gem  ./ruby_gem_install.sh mdl
#
# will be picked up by new shells via .bash.d/paths.sh automatically detecting and adding ~/.gem/ruby/*/bin
#
# on macOS Catalina I now have Ruby 2.6 so this can install normally
mdl
