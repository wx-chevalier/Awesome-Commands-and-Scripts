usage_description="
Enables branch protection for one or more branches in the given GitHub repo (prevents deleting the branch or force pushing over it)

If no branch is specified, then applies branches protections to any of the following branches if they're found:
$default_branches_to_protect

XXX: Beware this could reset certain protection settings on the branch when run, such as enabling/disabling PR approvals due to the way the API bundles them together.
     This is the complete list of settings sent, which you'd need to modify near the top of this code to change:

$(jq . <<< "$settings")
