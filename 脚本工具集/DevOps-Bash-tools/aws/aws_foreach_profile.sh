usage_description="
Run a command against each AWS named profile configured for the local AWS CLIv2

This is powerful so use carefully!

WARNING: do not run any command reading from standard input, otherwise it will consume the profile names and exit after the first iteration

Requires AWS CLIv2 to be installed and configured (older AWS CLIv1 that is installed via pip doesn't support this)

All arguments become the command template

AWS_PROFILE is set in each iteration and {profile} is replaced in any commands


eg.
    ${0##*/} echo 'AWS_PROFILE=\$AWS_PROFILE, {profile\\}={profile}'

To set up your Kubernetes access to all clusters in all locally configured accounts using adjacent aws_kube_creds.sh script

    ${0##*/} aws_kube_creds.sh
