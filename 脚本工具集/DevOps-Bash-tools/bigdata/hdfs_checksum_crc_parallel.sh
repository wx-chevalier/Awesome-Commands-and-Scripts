usage(){
    cat <<EOF
Recurses HDFS path arguments outputting HDFS MD5-of-MD5 checksums for each file in parallel
since dfs command has slow startup

Calls HDFS command which is assumed to be in \$PATH

Capture stdout | sort > file.txt for comparisons

Make sure to kinit before running this if using a production Kerberized cluster

Setting environment variable SKIP_ZERO_BYTE_FILES to any value will skip files with zero bytes to save time since
they always return the same checksum anyway

Caveats:

HDFS command startup is slow and is called once per file so I work around this by launching several dfs commands
in parallel. Configure parallelism via environment variable PARALLELISM=N where N must be an integer

See Also:

hadoop_hdfs_files_native_checksums.jy

from the adjacent GitHub rep (outputs MD5-of-MD5 not CRC32 though):

I would have written this version in Python but the Snakebite library doesn't support checksum extraction
