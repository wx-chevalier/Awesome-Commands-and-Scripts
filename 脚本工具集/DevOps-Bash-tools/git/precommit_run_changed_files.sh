usage_description="
Runs pre-commit on all files changed on the current branch vs the default branch

Useful to reproduce pre-commit checks that are failing in pull requests to get your PRs to pass

WARNING: \$HOME/.mdlrc appears to be cumulative and will hide errors in git checkouts with local .mdlrc
         you will only realize this when your Pull Request checks fail on GitHub, so you may need to edit
         or delete your \$HOME/.mdlrc to stop it masking your local pre-commit testing

Requires git and pre-commit to be installed and must be run on the feature branch in the git repo checkout
